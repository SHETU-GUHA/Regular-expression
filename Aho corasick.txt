Aho- chorasick Algorithm: The aho- chorasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm. It is a kind of dictionary matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings within an input text. It matches all patterns simultaneously.


The data structure has one node for every prefix of every string in the dictionary. So if (bca) is in the dictionary, then there will be nodes for (bca), (bc), (b), and (). There is a black directed "child" arc from each node to a node whose name is found by appending one character. So there is a black arc from (bc) to (bca). There is a blue directed "suffix" arc from each node to the node that is the longest possible strict suffix of it in the graph.For example, there is a green arc from (bca) to (a) because (a) is the first node in the dictionary (i.e. a white node) that is reached when following the blue arcs to (ca) and then on to (a).
